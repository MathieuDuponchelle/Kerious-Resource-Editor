Selection shall belong to the Atlas.

When an object is selected, the first thing emitted will be "unselected"
Afterwards, "selected" shall be emitted,
propagating the selection to the photoshop, which will be connected.

When an Atlas is selected, the old atlas has its previous selection reset.

Selection will be iterable, and sprites and anims will have a boolean isAnim,
indicating whether the sprite is an animation(different color).
